The following 3d models represent the enclosure for the project.
.3dm is a rhinoCAD 3d model, and .stl is a more standard 3d format.

IF POSSIBLE, USE THE 3DM FILES

to lasercut the box, use the svg file included and import it into the laser cutting software of choice. then make sure your settings are correct and check dimensions. make sure the inside of the box is measured at 160 by 160 millimeters.
